# Vault Contracts
These are the smart contracts for Yiedl vaults. 

Each vault issues share tokens, which are unchanged from the previous vault implementation.

These vaults are written to work with the Synthetix protocol. 
Deposits and redeems are done with sUSD, and the corresponding increase and reduction in the portfolio, along with the minting or burning of share tokens, is done on-chain.
